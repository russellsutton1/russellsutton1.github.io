I am a senior engineering student at the University of Texas at Austin planning to graduate with a Bachelor of Science in December of 2020. My focus lies in microcontroller applications and firmware
development. My background of aerospace engineering has also given me an understanding of testing and validation processes, as well as structural design. This diverse skill set makes me an ideal
fit for versatile engineering roles.
