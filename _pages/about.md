I am a senior engineering student at the University of Texas at Austin planning to graduate with a Bachelor of Science in December of 2020. My focus lies in microcontroller applications and firmware
development. My background of aerospace engineering has also given me an understanding of testing and validation processes, as well as structural design. This diverse skill set makes me an ideal
fit for versatile engineering roles.

I am currently seeking an internship for the summer months of 2020 with potential to grow into a full time position in the spring of 2021. I am looking for a team that takes on multidisciplinary challenges
to leverage my diverse skill set, as well as to collaborate with others that share my motivation to continually learn and use new tools and technologies.

My current topics of intrest are Real Time Operating Systems and Linux Kernel development.
