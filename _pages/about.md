I am a senior engineering student at the University of Texas at Austin planning to graduate with a Bachelor of Science in December of 2020. I am interested in developing software for innovative
businesses where I can leverage my diverse background in software development, sensor integration, and engineering mechanics. My experience with low level software and digital electronics in addition to
 backend database development would make me an immediate contributor to modern applications of embedded systems.
 
 I enjoy the added challenges of embedded software development and believe my extensive programming work experience and lab based education has prepared me to handle 
 debugging on both a hardware and software level. My internship experience with a cybersecurity corporation has given me a great lens to approach embedded software development as the exponential growth of
  connected devices has pushed the need for more security focused development.

I am currently seeking full-time opportunities starting January 2021. I am looking for a team that takes on multidisciplinary challenges
to leverage my diverse skill set, as well as to collaborate with others that share my motivation to continually learn and use new tools and technologies.
