  After a very busy summer, I am delighted to report back to UT with a newfound area of intrest. Despite the unassuming industry of automatic door motor controllers, working at Door
 Controls was exciting and full of learning. I am certain this experience has had a great impact on my trajectory as an engineer, as this introduction to embedded systems helped me find
 my fascination of mediating hardware and software systems. My tenure at Door Controls was split between two projects, both of great affect to the quality assurance processes of their buisness.

  To put it in few words as possible, Door Controls refurbishes and develops motor controllers for doors. When using a hadicapped equipped door, there is a good chance Door Controls has had a
  hand in the distribution of the internal controller. My effort was focused on improving the refurbishment process by introducing electronically accessible records.
