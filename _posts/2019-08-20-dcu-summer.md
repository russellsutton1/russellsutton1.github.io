  After a very busy summer, I am delighted to report back to UT with a newfound area of intrest. Despite the unassuming industry of automatic door motor controllers, working at Door
 Controls was exciting and full of learning. I am certain this experience has had a great impact on my trajectory as an engineer, as this introduction to embedded systems helped me find
 my fascination of mediating hardware and software systems. My tenure at Door Controls was split between two projects, both of great affect to the quality assurance processes of their buisness.

Door Controls main operations lie in the refurbishment and development of motor controllers for automated doors. When using a hadicapped equipped door, there is a good chance Door Controls has had a
 hand in the distribution of the internal controller. My effort was focused on improving the refurbishment process by introducing electronically accessible records. For 25 years, Door Controls 
 has managed all refurbisment records through filing cabniets and storage rooms. All knowledge pertaining to standard refurbishment procedures was held within the minds of invaluable employees.
Although all repairs are documented, the storage of them made them inaccessible outside of the most dire circumstances. Developing a method to collect electronic records of refurbishments was the primary task
of the internship period, which was successfully completed and implented with a two intern team. Working as the lead developer was an invaluable experience, exposing me to test driven development, architecture design,
 and product support.
