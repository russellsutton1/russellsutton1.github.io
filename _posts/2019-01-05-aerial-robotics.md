&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Joining the Texas Aerial Robotics team was a decision I made early into my collegiate career, and has had a great deal of influence over my
projected career path. As my first real experience working with an extensive code base, It was a very formative experience for me, exposing me to high level concepts like autonomous vehicle
architecture, computer vision, and API usage. This also came with learning some basic procedures necessary to operate in a large collaborative code base. Picking up common
best practices including using Git, abiding by formatting conventions, and participating in code reviews all built the foundations of my programming abilities. Although I have had a substaintial
amount of programming experience from homeworks and independent projects, these new collaborative programming skills but gave me the ability to better manage my work and an understanding of
writing readable code.
