&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This coming semester will be highlighted by the development stages of a senior design project. I am excited to work as the project manager for a small team focused on the development an
unmanned aircraft system. This course is intended to expose students to systems engineering as well as design methodology, with a focus on quantative analysis of everything from performance
evaluations to requirement trade-offs. The current stage of the project is developing bids for the system. Our primary focus is finding a strong candidate for a case study to build off of for our system.
Having a strong understanding of the requirements provided is essential to having a successful design, so my role as project manager has entailed making sure all six team members
are on the same page regarding product expectations and common Unmanned Aircraft System architecture designs.
