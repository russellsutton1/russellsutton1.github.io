&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This coming semester will be highlighted by the development stages of a senior design project. I am excited to work as the project manager for a small team focused on the development an
unmanned aircraft system. This course is intended to expose students to systems engineering as well as design methodolgy, with a focus on quantative analysis of everything from performance
evaluations to requirement trade-offs.
