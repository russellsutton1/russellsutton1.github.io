Working with embedded systems throughout my tenure at Door Controls was a great experience, but lacking in mentorship. Although my supervisor could answer any circuitry related question,
I wanted reassurance in my methods of writing register level C code. This was directly addressed in my time with the UT Solar Vehicles Team. My role on the Battery Proctection System team entailed
writing firmware for an ARM microcontroller platform responsible for monitoring the state of the battery module. Working on a large scale platforom was great exposure to reliabilty oriented embedded architectures.
My preliminary duties involved creating drivers for various sensors.
